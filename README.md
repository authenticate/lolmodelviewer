# LOL Model Viewer

This project allows users to view models from League of Legends. It is useful for people looking to preview champion skins before purchasing or machinimists.

### Project Status

League of Legends has evolved faster than our reverse engineering efforts. Unfortunately, this project no longer works with a live build of the game. However, a compatible version of Super Teemo still lurks about the repository for your viewing pleasure.
